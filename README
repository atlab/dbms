dbms
====

This module contains 'dbms', a set of shell scripts for basic MySQL database 
managment/operation.

The script currently handles the following:

  - start db
  - stop db
  - report db status
  - db shell
  - mysqladmin launch
  - replica checksumming

In a mysqld_multi configured server installation. Specific documentation
remains to be written, for now, see the code and usage synopsys.

Some site-local configuration is currently hardcoded into the scripts,
more work will modularize this configuration and add other script actions.

These are, currently (at least):

   - mysql server socket locations
   - expectation that mysql root password is stored in ~/.my.cnf
